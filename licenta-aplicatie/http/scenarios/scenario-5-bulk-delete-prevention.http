### SCENARIO 5: Bulk Delete Prevention Testing
### ==============================================

### 5.1. Try bulk delete on protected table - should be blocked
DELETE http://localhost:8081/api/products

### Expected: 403 Forbidden - bulk delete operations are protected

###

### 5.2. Try bulk delete on protected payments - should be blocked
DELETE http://localhost:8081/api/payments

### Expected: 403 Forbidden

###

### 5.3. Check protection status to confirm tables are protected
GET http://localhost:8081/api/protection/summary
Accept: application/json

### Expected: Both tables should be protected (not in unprotected list)
